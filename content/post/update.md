Registration for the spring season remains open until April 3rd.  We
have two important notes for everyone:

 <!--more--> 

* Due to low demand, we have decided not to hold a U12 Recreational
  League this season.  We have expanded our participation in the Rec
  Plus leagues to accommodate Northside soccer families.

* We still have spots on the U12 Boys team.  Other teams are filling
  quickly, so we advise you register today.
