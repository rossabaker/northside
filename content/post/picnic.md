Saturday, September 22 is our Northside Soccer League Wide Picnic. For
those that have been a part of our league before you know this is a
really nice experience for our kids. <!--more-->

The picnic will run from 9 am to 12 PM and there are no costs to
participate.  We are in need of a number of volunteers.  Please
consider [donating one hour of your
time](http://signup.com/go/pueQBHE) to help us continue this great
event.
