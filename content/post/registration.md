## Rec

Our rec league plays other teams in our league in a low-stress soccer
environment.  All rec teams are coed.  Soccer age is determined by the
child's age on January 1, 2017.

* U6 (ages 4-5)
* U8 (ages 6-7)
* U10 (ages 8-9)

We have decided not to hold a U12 Recreational League this season.  We
have expanded our participation in the Rec Plus leagues to accommodate
Northside soccer families.

Our Rec Plus program is slightly more competitive.  Rec Plus teams
play other local area teams.  We have boys, girls, and coed teams for
various age groups.  Soccer age is based on the child's age on January
1, 2017.

* U12 boys (ages 10-11)
* U12 girls (ages 10-11)
* U14 boys (ages 12-13)
* U14 girls (ages 12-13)
