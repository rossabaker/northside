Thank you for your interest in Northside Soccer. Here is some
information regarding our league:

Who is Northside Soccer?
: We are a small recreational soccer league run completely by
  volunteers. Our motto is "everybody plays" and we focus on ensuring
  all children and families have a good experience.

Where are practices and games held?
: All games and practices are held at [Sahm Park].

When are practices?
: When you sign up, you choose if you want to practice Tuesday or
  Thursday night.

When are games?
: Most Rec (our house league) games are on Saturdays. We typically
  play seven Saturdays through the season, skipping Labor Day or
  Memorial Day weekends.

  * The U6 league plays at 9:00am.
  * The U8 league plays at 10:15am.
  * The U10 league plays at 9:15am.

  To fit in an eighth game, we typically play once on a Tuesday or
  Thursday in lieu of the regular Rec practice.

  Rec Plus games are typically Saturdays and Sundays.  Scheduling is
  done in concert with other local clubs.  Some weekends are off, and
  some weekends may see a game both days.

What is the difference between Rec, Rec Plus and Travel Soccer?
: Recreational (Rec) Soccer is for beginners and children/families that
  are looking for a good, low-stress soccer environment. Rec teams only
  play other teams in our league. It is good for children who want to
  play soccer as well as other sports/activities. 

  Rec Plus soccer is for children/families looking for slightly more
  competitive soccer but not wanting to make the commitment required for
  travel soccer. Rec Plus teams play other local area teams. There are no
  try-outs allowed. 

  Travel soccer is competitive soccer, often significantly more
  expensive for children/families that are looking to make a significant
  soccer commitment. 

  Northside Soccer offers only Rec and Rec Plus teams.

What are the registration fees?
: The Rec registration fee is $105.  The Rec Plus Fee is $115.

  There is a $10 early bird discount if you register before January 31,
  and a $5 sibling discount is provided for families with more than one
  child participating.

  We require a credit card payment during registration.  We may charge
  a $15 fee in case of a refund.  For any questions or issues, please
  contact our finance team at treasurer@northsidesoccer.com.

What is included in that fee?
: The registration fee covers jersey, shorts, socks, team picture, a
  trophy and free admission in a league-wide picnic (with bounce houses,
  face painting, etc.).  The Rec fee also includes two tickets for snacks
  at the concession stand after each game.

When does the season start?
: Please see the [calendar].

When are practices?
: Rec teams practice on Tuesdays or Thursdays.  Select your preference
  during registration.  Most teams practice at 6:30pm for 45 minutes
  to an hour, at the discretion of the coaches.
  
  Rec Plus teams practice both Tuesdays and Thursdays, typically for
  around 90 minutes.

How can I get involved?
