Thank you for your interest in Northside Soccer. Here is some
information regarding our league:

Who is Northside Soccer?
: We are a small recreational soccer league run completely by
  volunteers. Our motto is "everybody plays" and we focus on ensuring
  all children and families have a good experience.

Where are practices and games held?
: All games and practices are held at [Sahm Park].

When are practices?
: When you sign up, you choose if you want to practice Tuesday or
  Thursday night.

When are games?
: All Rec (our house league) games are on Saturdays. There are 8 games
  in all.

  * The U6 league plays at 9:00am.
  * The U8 league plays at 10:00am.
  * The U10 league plays at 9:00am.

What is the difference between Rec, Rec Plus and Travel Soccer?
: Recreational (Rec) Soccer is for beginners and children/families that
  are looking for a good, low-stress soccer environment. Rec teams only
  play other teams in our league. It is good for children who want to
  play soccer as well as other sports/activities. 

  Rec Plus soccer is for children/families looking for slightly more
  competitive soccer but not wanting to make the commitment required for
  travel soccer. Rec Plus teams play other local area teams. There are no
  try-outs allowed. 

  Travel soccer is competitive soccer, often significantly more
  expensive for children/families that are looking to make a significant
  soccer commitment. 

  Northside Soccer offers only Rec and Rec Plus teams.

What are the registration fees?
: The Rec registration fee is $100.  The Rec Plus Fee is $110.

  There is a $10 early bird discount if you register before January 31,
  and a $5 sibling discount is provided for families with more than one
  child participating.

What is included in that fee?
: The registration fee covers jersey, shorts, socks, team picture, a
  trophy and free admission in a league-wide picnic (with bounce houses,
  face painting, etc.).  The Rec fee also includes two tickets for snacks
  at the concession stand after each game.

When does the season start?
