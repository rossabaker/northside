Hello Northside families,

Another successful week in the books and the season is humming along.  Thanks to everyone involved, from parents to coaches and volunteers and especially the kids, for making it happen.

An important date to note this week: Tuesday May 4 is Chipotle Night, Northside's only fundraiser this season.<!-- more -->  From 5-9 p.m. at the Chipotle restaurant in Castleton (5320 E. 82nd St.), a portion of the profits from every Northside-affiliated purchase will go toward the league's budget. This is a big night for the league to keep it running smoothly in this and future seasons, so please help out!

You can order in person or online to pick-up at the restaurant during those hours. If ordering in person, you must mention Northside Soccer while ordering to make your order eligible to be included in the fundraiser.  If ordering online for carry-out, you can use the order code HNF9GBM to ensure your order is counted.  There is a link below to an online flyer you can reference or share.

Please plan to take part and spread the word so we can make this fundraiser a success!!

Thanks,
The Northside Board
