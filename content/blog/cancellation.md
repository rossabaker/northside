Hello Northside Soccer Families,

The Northside Soccer Board has been closely monitoring the status of COVID-19 in the hopes that we would be able to have a modified spring soccer season, possibly even going into the summer. Unfortunately, with the uncertain timeline specific to resuming youth sports, we will not be able to have a spring soccer season.

This is very disheartening because we believed that providing a soccer season for the Northside Soccer families would have been an important part of the healing process for many. What makes Northside Soccer so special is the community: parents and families that come together to help our players have an enjoyable, successful soccer experience. In this world of ultra competitiveness, Northside Soccer has created an environment where our children can play soccer without undue pressure to win, while learning how to work hard, be a good teammate, and ultimately have fun. For these reasons, we believe Northside Soccer has made a lasting impression on thousands of families over the years!

We are hopeful to see everyone happy, healthy, and ready to play soccer in the fall!

Northside Soccer Board
