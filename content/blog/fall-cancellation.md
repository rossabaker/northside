Hello Northside Soccer families,

The Northside Board regrets to announce the cancellation of the Fall 2020 season at both the Rec and Rec Plus levels. We have been monitoring the public health guidance, surveying our families, and discussing with neighbor clubs in the hopes of a normal, viable, and, most importantly, safe fall season. After this evaluation, we have determined that it doesn’t make sense for Northside to host a Fall 2020 season.

This decision was not made lightly. Northside is a small volunteer run club. We have spent many hours discussing how we could safely have a season and we just don’t feel comfortable that we can put the appropriate controls in place to keep the league and the community safe.

At this time, we are looking forward to returning in Spring 2021. We will be sending another communication when the Spring 2021 season registration is open.

Thank you,
Northside Soccer Board
