Northside Families,

We hope that everyone is staying healthy during this strange and difficult time.
<!--more-->
The Northside board members are closely monitoring the status of COVID-19 along with the Indiana State Soccer Association and the school administration guidelines for both Hamilton and Marion Counties.

We believe that providing a soccer season for the Northside Soccer families can be an important part of the healing process for many. With this being said, we are in the process of finding solutions to provide a Spring season with a modified schedule. Our solutions will continue to evolve as more information emerges regarding COVID-19.

At a minimum, the following conditions must be met for us to open our Spring season:

1. Both Marion and Hamilton County Schools must be back in session
2. Approval of Marion County Department of Public Health
3. Approval of the Indiana State Soccer Association
4. Approval of Indy Parks

As of today, schools are not returning until the week of May 4th. We will send another communication no later than the week of April 26 with an update on the Spring season.

Your patience is appreciated as we work through this unprecedented situation.

Northside Soccer Board
